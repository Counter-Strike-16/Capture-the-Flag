# Prod VM Setup

This is set up to be run directly from your repo directory. Just run

	challenge_setup <boxname.box> <pc username>
	
from <ctf repo>/vm_setup/prod. It will create the directory C:/challenge_vm to store
the packaged box and the Vagrantfile created by the script.

The boxname.box can be anything you want (just needs to end in '.box') - it is necessary
because Vagrant will reuse boxes if they've already been named, rather than creating the
new one. Your pc username (i.e. rob.denman) is needed to check if that box already exists, 
and if it does, it will be deleted to make room for the new one. Make sure you don't
overwrite a box you were wanting to hold on to!
