the snow glows white on the mountain tonight
not a footprint to be seen
a kingdom of isolation,
and it looks like im the queen.

the wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
couldnt keep it in, heaven knows i tried!

dont let them in, dont let them see
be the good girl you always have to be
conceal, dont feel, dont let them know
well, now they know!

let it go, let it go
cant hold it back anymore
let it go, let it go
turn away and slam the door!

i dont care
what theyre going to say
let the storm rage on,
the cold never bothered me anyway!

the flag is on the line below
thats right; the flag is letitgo!

its funny how some distance
makes everything seem small
and the fears that once controlled me
cant get to me at all!

its time to see what i can do
to test the limits and break through
no right, no wrong, no rules for me im free!

let it go, let it go
i am one with the wind and sky
let it go, let it go
youll never see me cry!

here i stand
and here ill stay
let the storm rage on!

my power flurries through the air into the ground
my soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
and one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
im never going back,
the past is in the past!

let it go, let it go
and ill rise like the break of dawn
let it go, let it go
that perfect girl is gone!

here i stand
in the light of day
let the storm rage on,
the cold never bothered me anyway!
