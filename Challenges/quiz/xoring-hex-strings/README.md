# XORing Hex Strings

## Description:

Using XOR, decipher the following hex-encoded ciphertext:

   9486b98aafa312b37889895ff5b5542aeecf9bfa

with the key:

   ccc9ebe3c1c432da0ba9e73081951665bca6f59d

Once you have the decoded message, convert it from hex to ascii for the answer.

## Hint

While this can be done manually, Python's int() function and ^ operator can speed significantly speed things up

## Flag

XORing is not BORing

## Write-Up
