## Write-Up

The Rail Fence cipher is a form of transposition cipher (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_cipher).

For this challenge, we use 5 rails to find the answer:

````
T.......R.......R.......N.......T.
.H.....P.E.....I.D.....E.C.....A.A
..I...A...T...E...W...O...R...D...
...S.S.....T.W.....A.T.....Y.T....
....I.......Y.......Y.......P.....
````
