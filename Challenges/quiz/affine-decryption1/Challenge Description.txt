Description :

You are provided the following encryption function: f(x)=17x+13[26]
First, you have to encrypt the word INFINITE with this function.
Then, your mission is to find the decryption function g.
Finally, you have to decrypt the word CAMPUS.

Indications:

[26] means "modulo 26".
The decryption function will be of the following form: g(y)=ay+b[26], with a and b natural integers lower than 26, and y=f(x).
You will enter the flag lowercase on the form
(crypted word)_(decryption function)_(decrypted word).


Example:
If the encryption of INFINITE was AEXAEAJO, that the function was g(y)=15y+3[26], and that the decryption of GELKT was SUPER, then the flag would be: AEXAEAJO_15y+3[26]_SUPER
